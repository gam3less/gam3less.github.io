## Operating System
Most [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) Operating Systems are great for privacy however they are annoying to get used to. Windows is not recommended however it can be improved.
### Improving Windows
To improve windows security you can use a powershell script.  
The following script is from Chris Titus' website. [Click here to go to his website](https://christitus.com/debloat-windows-10-2020/)  

1) To use this script open powershell as an admin (Right Click start icon and click run powershell (admin))

2) Paste (Right Click) the following command in and press enter.
```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JJ8R4'))
```

3) A menu like this should appear:

4) Click on Essential Tweaks, High Security and Security Updates Only

## Browser
Librewolf is recommended as it is the best for user expireance and privacy. However it is only avalible on Linux currently.  

I recommend using [WaterFox](https://www.waterfox.net/), it is a fork of Firefox but is more private and secure while still maintaining speed.
[Download WaterFox Here](https://cdn.waterfox.net/releases/win64/installer/Waterfox%20G3.0.2%20Setup.exe)  

### Search Engine
I recommend you switch to [StartPage](https://startpage.com/)  
This will make sure google can't track your searches and cant track you across pages.  

1) Open Waterfox and go to tools then options.  
2) Click on search  
3) Change default search engine to StartPage

### Extensions
Here are some essential extensions I would recommend:  
[uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)  
[ClearURLS](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/)  
[HTTPS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/)  

## E-mail
Personally I use [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) but you can also use [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/)  

When signing up for new things always use an E-Mail aliases.  
I recommended using [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com/) because its super easy to set up and use.  

## VPN
The point of a VPN is to hide your IP from the government and your ISP (Internet service provider)  
They are also essential when torrenting.  

Most VPNS are fine, however [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) is easy to set up and I will show you how to get it for free.  

### How to get a NordVPN account for free.
**WARNING** These accounts are stolen, however are useful **WARNING**
It's pretty easy, just go to [H-gen](https://www.h-gen.xyz/) and choose NordVPN.  
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/lwKQs4A.png)  
1) Press Generate.  
2) Scroll down and press Free Access  
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/d3Txoqh.png)  
3) Copy and paste your account into NordVPN the format is User:Pass  
4) Here is the account I generated: ajvarela@bak.rr.com:Austin0822  

## Password Manager
A password manager makes your life a lot easier.  
I recommend setting up [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), or you can use a pen a paper and make unique passwords for each of your accounts.  
Bitwarden is Open Source and you can use it from anywhere.
