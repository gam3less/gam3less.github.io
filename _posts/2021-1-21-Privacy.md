## Operating System
Most [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) Operating Systems are great for privacy however they are annoying to get used to. Windows is not recommended however it can be improved.
### Improving Windows
To improve windows security you can use a powershell script.  
The following script is from Chris Titus' website. [Click here to go to his website](https://christitus.com/debloat-windows-10-2020/)  

1) To use this script open powershell as an admin (Right Click start icon and click run powershell (admin))

4) Click on Essential Tweaks, High Security and Security Updates Only


## Browser
Librewolf is recommended as it is the best for user expireance and privacy. However it is only avalible on Linux currently.  

I recommend using [WaterFox](https://www.waterfox.net/), it is a fork of Firefox but is more private and secure while still maintaining speed.
[Download WaterFox Here](https://cdn.waterfox.net/releases/win64/installer/Waterfox%20G3.0.2%20Setup.exe)
